Hi,my name is Alex hu (Chinese: 胡锦豪)，a junior at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu/), majoring in Management Information Systems, Mathematics, and Data Science. I’m also enrolled as a JEI (Joint Educational Institute) student at the [SWUFE-UD Institute](https://dids.swufe.edu.cn/) of Data Science in Chengdu, China.


Currently, I serve as the class monitor for the Information Management and Information Systems major at the SWUFE-UD. At the same time, I am studying for the TOEFL and GRE exams to prepare for studying abroad in the future.

In terms of my major, I work at Takin.AI and HiddenArt.AI teams, mainly responsible for website testing and writing AI tutorials. I previously worked as a risk modeling and analysis assistant at Zhejiang Tailong Commercial Bank, where my main responsibility was SQL analysis of the non-performing loan ratio of corporate clients and writing analysis reports on the role of ChatGPT in the banking industry.

Additionally, I am an assistant at the International Affairs Office of the SWUFE-UD, where I primarily organize the "Professors Speeches" event. I coordinate for students to attend lectures given by foreign professors about their personal experiences and graduate application processes. Furthermore, I assist newly joined foreign faculty members in touring the campus and introduce them to the campus environment and troubleshoot classroom equipment.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching American TV series and listening to music. I am also a versatile sports enthusiast, with particular proficiency in badminton, table tennis, volleyball, and basketball, listed in descending order of skill level.
