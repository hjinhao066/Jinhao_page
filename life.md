My College Life in Chengdu ✨🏫

Welcome to my journey through university! This page highlights my experiences and achievements during my time in Chengdu.

🌀 Freshman Year: Confusion and Exploration

As a freshman entering university, I felt a deep sense of confusion. To fit in, I followed my peers and spent a lot of time playing League of Legends 🎮. At the same time, I ventured into stock trading 📈, something I had always been curious about. With an initial investment of 20,000 yuan borrowed from my family 💰, I started trading during the initial metaverse boom, investing 5,000 yuan and making a small profit of 500 yuan 💹. Encouraged by this success, I increased my position, but ultimately, I kept losing money 📉. Over the course of a year, I actively engaged in stock trading, participated in the 688¥ community, joined a private stock-sharing group that cost 2,000 yuan per month, and even purchased stock trading software for 20,000 yuan per year 💸. Eventually, I switched to trading convertible bonds, but my losses continued, forcing me to quit ❌.

While I was immersed in trading, my academic performance suffered 📚. I neglected my studies, resulting in an average GPA of 3.4 for the academic year.

🌱 Sophomore Year: Realization and Transformation

In my sophomore year, I realized that I couldn’t continue down this path of distraction and underachievement 🚀. Determined to change, I actively sought new opportunities and took on leadership roles. I joined the International Affairs Office as an assistant and played a key role in organizing multiple Professors’ Speeches events 🎤, which facilitated meaningful interactions between students and foreign faculty. These experiences not only helped me develop communication and organizational skills but also broadened my perspective on academic and career growth 🌍.

Recognizing the importance of academic excellence, I strategically selected elective courses to boost my GPA 📈. One of my proudest achievements was in my accounting course, where I significantly improved my performance—from scoring 60 on my first exam to 88 on the second, and ultimately achieving 97.5 on the final exam, bringing my overall score to 91 🏅. By the end of the academic year, I had raised my GPA to 3.86 and was awarded both B-level and C-level academic scholarships 🏆.

🎓 Junior Year: Consistency, Preparation, and New Adventures

By my junior year, I had developed a strong sense of discipline and direction 📖. I worked as an assistant for the school’s counselor, balancing my responsibilities while managing lighter coursework to maintain a high GPA 📝. Knowing that my future would involve international opportunities, I focused on preparing for language proficiency exams, including TOEFL and GRE ✈️.

That summer, I traveled abroad for the first time to attend a summer school program at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada 🇨🇦. This experience was incredibly eye-opening, as it allowed me to immerse myself in a global academic environment, enhance my analytical skills, and interact with students from diverse backgrounds 🌏. After completing the program, I took the opportunity to visit Toronto and witness the breathtaking beauty of Niagara Falls 🌊. This journey not only expanded my worldview but also reinforced my determination to pursue further studies abroad 🌟.

Through these years, my university experience in Chengdu evolved from confusion and exploration to self-discovery, transformation, and preparation for the future. The challenges I faced shaped me into a more focused, resilient, and globally-minded individual, ready to embrace new opportunities in both academia and beyond 🚀.
