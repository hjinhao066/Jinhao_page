### Freshman Year - Exploration & Lessons | 大一·探索与试错
🔥 **"Metaverse Hype & Market Reality"**  
Initially caught in the gaming frenzy of *Naraka: Bladepoint* to fit in, I soon ventured into stock trading with ¥20,000 seed money. Early success (10% return in metaverse stocks) blinded me to risks. Later investments turned disastrous:  
- 🎮 2000+ hours in gaming  
- 💸 ¥20k evaporated through failed strategies  
- 📉 Switched to convertible bonds - same outcome  
- 📚 GPA 3.4: Bare-minimum academic effort  

*"Learned the hard way: Markets reward patience, not impulse"*

As a freshman entering university, my main theme was confusion. In order to fit in, I followed others and played the game "League of Legends." At the same time, I also engaged in stock trading, which was something I had always wanted to do. I asked my family for 20,000 yuan for investment, but in reality, it was for stock trading. During the initial metaverse boom, I invested 5,000 yuan and made a profit of 500 yuan. As a result, I increased my position, but ultimately, I kept losing money. I spent a year trading stocks, participating in the 688 community, joining a private stock-sharing group that cost 2,000 yuan per month, and purchasing a stock trading software that cost 20,000 yuan per year. I eventually switched to trading convertible bonds, but it was just another way of losing money. In the end, I was forced to quit. I didn't pay much attention to studying, and my grades were just average, resulting in a GPA of only 3.4 for the entire academic year.

In my sophomore year, I realized that I couldn't continue down this path of degradation. I joined the International Affairs Office of the School as an assistant and organized multiple "Professors' Speeches" events. The foreign teachers' sharing helped me gradually gain clarity about my future and become more informed about studying abroad. I gradually realized the importance of GPA and chose some elective courses that could boost my grades. The achievement I'm most proud of is my Accounting course, where I went from scoring 60 points on the first exam to 88 on the second, and finally 97.5 on the last exam, resulting in an overall score of 91 for the entire Accounting course. During this academic year, my GPA was 3.86, and I received the B and C-level academic scholarships.

In my junior year, I worked as an assistant for the School's counselor, and my coursework was relatively light, allowing me to maintain my GPA. Simultaneously, I prepared for language proficiency exams like the TOEFL and GRE.111


[//]: # (这个页面主要介绍我在大学的生活以及收获。

大一出入大学，我的主旋律是迷茫的，为了合群也就跟着玩永劫无间（游戏），同时也进行了我一直以来都想要进行的炒股的活动，问家里要了2万块钱来投资，其实是炒股。在最开始的元宇宙行情中我投入的5000 赚到了500， 于是我就加大仓位，结果就是不断的亏钱。炒股一年，参加过688 的社群，参加过2000一个月的私人股票分享群，买过2万一年的炒股软件，从炒股变成炒可转债。也不过是换了途径亏钱。最终，腰折出局。也没有非常在意学习这件事，成绩也就是将就学着，所以，我整个学年的GPA只有3.4。

大二 我觉得不能在这样堕落下去了，，参加了学院国际事务交流处的助管，主办了多次“师说背题活动”，外教老师的分享也让我对自己的未来逐渐清晰，对出国也越来越了解，逐渐意识到了GPA的重要性，选了一些能够给分高的公选课，同时认真学习，最自豪的一件事情是我的会计学课程，从第一次考试的60分 到第二次的88到最后一次的97.5分这也让我整个会计学上了 91 分。同时，我整个学年的GPA3.86 这一年获得丙等、乙等学业奖学金

大三 给学院的辅导员做过助管，同时课程比较轻松，继续保持绩点，然后就是确定了要去美国，然后开始征战托福考试，6 战托福最终 98分极限了，转战雅思，3 周出分，7分。然后开始申请总共是而且是一共20个项目。基本都上都是写好一个大概然后让 AI 弄。
